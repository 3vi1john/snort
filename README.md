Snort IDS/IPS scripts/rules/etc <BR>

snort-install.sh script installs snort and barnyard. In order for it to go smoothly, <BR>

place snort.conf from this repo and the downloaded VRT rules from snort.org in /tmp.<BR>
If the rules version has changed just alter the section of snort-install.sh to reflect the name.
