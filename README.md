Snort IDS/IPS scripts/rules/etc <BR>

snort-install.sh script installs snort and barnyard on ubuntu linux 64bit. In order for it to go smoothly, <BR>
place your oinkcode in the proper line in order to download latest vrt registered user rules.<BR>

The barnyard section assumes that the mysql database is on another server. This is just personal <BR>
preference and how I like to configure things. If you are interested in how to set that up just <BR>
shoot me an email.
